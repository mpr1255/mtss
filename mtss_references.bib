@article{Errington2021-ra,
	abstract = {Replicability is an important feature of scientific research, but
              aspects of contemporary research culture, such as an emphasis on
              novelty, can make replicability seem less important than it
              should be. The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology was set up
              to provide evidence about the replicability of preclinical
              research in cancer biology by repeating selected experiments from
              high-impact papers. A total of 50 experiments from 23 papers were
              repeated, generating data about the replicability of a total of
              158 effects. Most of the original effects were positive effects
              (136), with the rest being null effects (22). A majority of the
              original effect sizes were reported as numerical values (117),
              with the rest being reported as representative images (41). We
              employed seven methods to assess replicability, and some of these
              methods were not suitable for all the effects in our sample. One
              method compared effect sizes: for positive effects, the median
              effect size in the replications was 85\% smaller than the median
              effect size in the original experiments, and 92\% of replication
              effect sizes were smaller than the original. The other methods
              were binary - the replication was either a success or a failure -
              and five of these methods could be used to assess both positive
              and null effects when effect sizes were reported as numerical
              values. For positive effects, 40\% of replications (39/97)
              succeeded according to three or more of these five methods, and
              for null effects 80\% of replications (12/15) were successful on
              this basis; combining positive and null effects, the success rate
              was 46\% (51/112). A successful replication does not definitively
              confirm an original finding or its theoretical interpretation.
              Equally, a failure to replicate does not disconfirm a finding,
              but it does suggest that additional investigation is needed to
              establish its reliability.},

@unpublished{Lakens2019-lt,
	abstract = {For over two centuries researchers have been criticized for using
              research practices that makes it easier to present data in line
              with what they wish to be true. With the rise of the internet it
              has become easier to preregister the theoretical and empirical
              basis for predictions, the experimental design, the materials,
              and the analysis code. Whether the practice of preregistration is
              valuable depends on your philosophy of science. Here, I provide a
              conceptual analysis of the value of preregistration for
              psychological science from an error statistical philosophy (Mayo,
              2018). Preregistration has the goal to allow others to
              transparently evaluate the capacity of a test to falsify a
              prediction, or the severity of a test. Researchers who aim to
              test predictions with severity should find value in the practice
              of preregistration. I differentiate the goal of preregistration
              from positive externalities, discuss how preregistration itself
              does not make a study better or worse compared to a
              non-preregistered study, and highlight the importance of
              evaluating the usefulness of a tool such as preregistration based
              on an explicit consideration of your philosophy of science.},

	abstract = {Pre-analysis plans (PAPs) have been championed as a solution to
               the problem of research credibility, but without any evidence
               that PAPs actually bolster the credibility of research. We
               analyze a representative sample of 195 PAPs registered on the
               Evidence in Governance and Politics (EGAP) and American Economic
               Association (AEA) registration platforms to assess whether PAPs
               registered in the early days of pre-registration (2011--2016)
               were sufficiently clear, precise, and comprehensive to achieve
               their objective of preventing ``fishing'' and reducing the scope
               for post-hoc adjustment of research hypotheses. We also analyze
               a subset of ninety-three PAPs from projects that resulted in
               publicly available papers to ascertain how faithfully they
               adhere to their pre-registered specifications and hypotheses. We
               find significant variation in the extent to which PAPs
               registered during this period accomplished the goals they were
               designed to achieve. We discuss these findings in light of both
               the costs and benefits of pre-registration, showing how our
               results speak to the various arguments that have been made in
               support of and against PAPs. We also highlight the norms and
               institutions that will need to be strengthened to augment the
               power of PAPs to improve research credibility and to create
               incentives for researchers to invest in both producing and
               policing them.},

@article{Errington2021-zg,
	abstract = {We conducted the Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology to
              investigate the replicability of preclinical research in cancer
              biology. The initial aim of the project was to repeat 193
              experiments from 53 high-impact papers, using an approach in
              which the experimental protocols and plans for data analysis had
              to be peer reviewed and accepted for publication before
              experimental work could begin. However, the various barriers and
              challenges we encountered while designing and conducting the
              experiments meant that we were only able to repeat 50 experiments
              from 23 papers. Here we report these barriers and challenges.
              First, many original papers failed to report key descriptive and
              inferential statistics: the data needed to compute effect sizes
              and conduct power analyses was publicly accessible for just 4 of
              193 experiments. Moreover, despite contacting the authors of the
              original papers, we were unable to obtain these data for 68\% of
              the experiments. Second, none of the 193 experiments were
              described in sufficient detail in the original paper to enable us
              to design protocols to repeat the experiments, so we had to seek
              clarifications from the original authors. While authors were
              extremely or very helpful for 41\% of experiments, they were
              minimally helpful for 9\% of experiments, and not at all helpful
              (or did not respond to us) for 32\% of experiments. Third, once
              experimental work started, 67\% of the peer-reviewed protocols
              required modifications to complete the research and just 41\% of
              those modifications could be implemented. Cumulatively, these
              three factors limited the number of experiments that could be
              repeated. This experience draws attention to a basic and
              fundamental concern about replication - it is hard to assess
              whether reported findings are credible.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: We explore whether the number of null results in
               large National Heart Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) funded
               trials has increased over time. METHODS: We identified all large
               NHLBI supported RCTs between 1970 and 2012 evaluating drugs or
               dietary supplements for the treatment or prevention of
               cardiovascular disease. Trials were included if direct costs
               >\$500,000/year, participants were adult humans, and the primary
               outcome was cardiovascular risk, disease or death. The 55 trials
               meeting these criteria were coded for whether they were
               published prior to or after the year 2000, whether they
               registered in clinicaltrials.gov prior to publication, used
               active or placebo comparator, and whether or not the trial had
               industry co-sponsorship. We tabulated whether the study reported
               a positive, negative, or null result on the primary outcome
               variable and for total mortality. RESULTS: 17 of 30 studies
               (57\%) published prior to 2000 showed a significant benefit of
               intervention on the primary outcome in comparison to only 2
               among the 25 (8\%) trials published after 2000 ($\chi$2=12.2,df=
               1, p=0.0005). There has been no change in the proportion of
               trials that compared treatment to placebo versus active
               comparator. Industry co-sponsorship was unrelated to the
               probability of reporting a significant benefit. Pre-registration
               in clinical trials.gov was strongly associated with the trend
               toward null findings. CONCLUSIONS: The number NHLBI trials
               reporting positive results declined after the year 2000.
               Prospective declaration of outcomes in RCTs, and the adoption of
               transparent reporting standards, as required by
               clinicaltrials.gov, may have contributed to the trend toward
               null findings.},

The Roundtable convened a virtual public workshop on fostering open science practices on November 5, 2020. The broad goal of the workshop was to identify paths to growing the nascent coalition of stakeholders committed to reenvisioning credit\/reward systems (e.g., academic hiring, tenure and promotion, and grants)to fully incentivize open science practices. The workshop explored the information and resource needs of researchers, research institutions, government agencies, philanthropies, professional societies, and other stakeholders interested in further supporting and implementing open science practices.

              article contained some errors. One line of code was incorrect in
              the script that generated results for Rugg (1941). Effectively,
              the authors failed to correctly invert two of the columns in
              Tables 2 and 3. The revised statistics do not alter the
              substantive conclusions for this effect (e.g., it remains a
              successful replication), however the correct effect size is much
              smaller and closer to the result reported in the original study.
              In addition, a typo was incorrect in Table 2, that led to the df
              and N reported for one of the anchoring studies to be slightly
              off. The corrections are included in the erratum. (PsycInfo

@article{Klein2018-gr,
	abstract = {We conducted preregistered replications of 28 classic and
               contemporary published findings, with protocols that were peer
               reviewed in advance, to examine variation in effect magnitudes
               across samples and settings. Each protocol was administered to
               approximately half of 125 samples that comprised 15,305
               participants from 36 countries and territories. Using the
               conventional criterion of statistical significance (p < .05), we
               found that 15 (54\%) of the replications provided evidence of a
               statistically significant effect in the same direction as the
               original finding. With a strict significance criterion (p <
               .0001), 14 (50\%) of the replications still provided such
               evidence, a reflection of the extremely high-powered design.
               Seven (25\%) of the replications yielded effect sizes larger
               than the original ones, and 21 (75\%) yielded effect sizes
               smaller than the original ones. The median comparable Cohen?s ds
               were 0.60 for the original findings and 0.15 for the
               replications. The effect sizes were small (< 0.20) in 16 of the
               replications (57\%), and 9 effects (32\%) were in the direction
               opposite the direction of the original effect. Across settings,
               the Q statistic indicated significant heterogeneity in 11 (39\%)
               of the replication effects, and most of those were among the
               findings with the largest overall effect sizes; only 1 effect
               that was near zero in the aggregate showed significant
               heterogeneity according to this measure. Only 1 effect had a tau
               value greater than .20, an indication of moderate heterogeneity.
               Eight others had tau values near or slightly above .10, an
               indication of slight heterogeneity. Moderation tests indicated
               that very little heterogeneity was attributable to the order in
               which the tasks were performed or whether the tasks were
               administered in lab versus online. Exploratory comparisons
               revealed little heterogeneity between Western, educated,
               industrialized, rich, and democratic (WEIRD) cultures and less
               WEIRD cultures (i.e., cultures with relatively high and low
               WEIRDness scores, respectively). Cumulatively, variability in
               the observed effect sizes was attributable more to the effect
               being studied than to the sample or setting in which it was
               studied.},

              can influence research outcomes in such a way that it leads to
              overconfidence in statistical conclusions. One proposed method to
              increase the interpretability of a research finding is
              preregistration, which involves documenting analytic choices on a
              public, third-party repository prior to any influence by data. To
              investigate whether, in psychology, preregistration lives up to
              that potential, we focused on all articles published in
              Psychological Science with a preregistered badge between February
              2015 and November 2017, and assessed the adherence to their
              corresponding preregistration plans. We observed deviations from
              the plan in all studies, and, more importantly, in all but one
              study, at least one of these deviations was not fully disclosed.

              postures, and they express powerlessness through closed,
              contractive postures. But can these postures actually cause
              power? The results of this study confirmed our prediction that
              posing in high-power nonverbal displays (as opposed to low-power
              nonverbal displays) would cause neuroendocrine and behavioral
              changes for both male and female participants: High-power posers
              experienced elevations in testosterone, decreases in cortisol,
              and increased feelings of power and tolerance for risk; low-power
              posers exhibited the opposite pattern. In short, posing in
              displays of power caused advantaged and adaptive psychological,
              physiological, and behavioral changes, and these findings suggest
              that embodiment extends beyond mere thinking and feeling, to
              physiology and subsequent behavioral choices. That a person can,
              by assuming two simple 1-min poses, embody power and instantly
              become more powerful has real-world, actionable implications.},

	abstract = {In this article, we accomplish two things. First, we show that
               despite empirical psychologists' nominal endorsement of a low
               rate of false-positive findings ($\leq$ .05), flexibility in
               data collection, analysis, and reporting dramatically increases
               actual false-positive rates. In many cases, a researcher is more
               likely to falsely find evidence that an effect exists than to
               correctly find evidence that it does not. We present computer
               simulations and a pair of actual experiments that demonstrate
               how unacceptably easy it is to accumulate (and report)
               statistically significant evidence for a false hypothesis.
               Second, we suggest a simple, low-cost, and straightforwardly
               effective disclosure-based solution to this problem. The
               solution involves six concrete requirements for authors and four
               guidelines for reviewers, all of which impose a minimal burden

               regression analyses of observational data, the 'true model'
               remains unknown, and researchers face a choice between plausible
               alternative specifications. Robustness testing allows
               researchers to explore the stability of their main estimates to
               plausible variations in model specifications. This highly
               accessible book presents the logic of robustness testing,
               provides an operational definition of robustness that can be
               applied in all quantitative research, and introduces readers to
               diverse types of robustness tests. Focusing on each dimension of
               model uncertainty in separate chapters, the authors provide a
               systematic overview of existing tests and develop many new ones.

	abstract = {ABSTRACTScientific research of all kinds should be guided by
               statistical thinking: in the design and conduct of the study, in
               the disciplined exploration and enlightened display of the data,
               and to avoid statistical pitfalls in the interpretation of the
               results. However, formal, probability-based statistical
               inference should play no role in most scientific research, which
               is inherently exploratory, requiring flexible methods of
               analysis that inherently risk overfitting. The nature of
               exploratory work is that data are used to help guide model
               choice, and under these circumstances, uncertainty cannot be
               precisely quantified, because of the inevitable model selection
               bias that results. To be valid, statistical inference should be
               restricted to situations where the study design and analysis
               plan are specified prior to data collection. Exploratory data
               analysis provides the flexibility needed for most other
               situations, including statistical methods that are regularized,
               robust, or nonparametric. Of course, no individual statistical
               analysis should be considered sufficient to establish scientific
               validity: research requires many sets of data along many lines
               of evidence, with a watchfulness for systematic error.
               Replicating and predicting findings in new data and new settings
               is a stronger way of validating claims than blessing results
               from an isolated study with statistical inferences.},

               scientists have been increasingly concerned about the degree of
               such distortion in their literature. A new publication format
               has been developed to prevent selective reporting: In Registered
               Reports (RRs), peer review and the decision to publish take
               place before results are known. We compared the results in
               published RRs (N = 71 as of November 2018) with a random sample
               of hypothesis-testing studies from the standard literature (N =
               152) in psychology. Analyzing the first hypothesis of each
               article, we found 96\% positive results in standard reports but
               only 44\% positive results in RRs. We discuss possible
               explanations for this large difference and suggest that a
               plausible factor is the reduction of publication bias and/or

               article in which 29 teams analyzed the same research question
               with the same data: Are soccer referees more likely to give red
               cards to players with dark skin tone than light skin tone? The
               results obtained by the teams differed extensively. Many

               In this article, we investigate why results diverged so much. We

               Teams differed in their interpretation of the research question
               and therefore used diverse research designs and model
               specifications. We show by reanalyzing the data that with a
               clear research question, a precise definition of the parameter
               of interest, and theory-guided causal reasoning, results vary
               only within a narrow range. The broad conclusion of our
               reanalysis is that social science research needs to be more

                   societies and even mass media are paying attention, often
                   focusing on the so-called ``crisis'' of reproducibility. One
                   big problem keeps coming up among those seeking to tackle
                   the issue: different groups are using terminologies in utter
                   contradiction with each other. Looking at a broad sample of
                   publications in different fields, we can classify their
                   terminology via decision tree: they either, A---make no
                   distinction between the words reproduce and replicate, or
                   B---use them distinctly. If B, then they are commonly
                   divided in two camps. In a spectrum of concerns that starts
                   at a minimum standard of ``same data+same methods=same
                   results,'' to ``new data and/or new methods in an
                   independent study=same findings,'' group 1 calls the minimum
                   standard reproduce, while group 2 calls it replicate. This
                   direct swap of the two terms aggravates an already weighty
                   issue. By attempting to inventory the terminologies across
                   disciplines, I hope that some patterns will emerge to help

	abstract = {One of the strongest findings across the sciences is that
               publication bias occurs. Of particular note is a ``file drawer
               bias'' where statistically significant results are privileged
               over nonsignificant results. Recognition of this bias, along
               with increased calls for ``open science,'' has led to an
               emphasis on replication studies. Yet, few have explored
               publication bias and its consequences in replication studies. We
               offer a model of the publication process involving an initial
               study and a replication. We use the model to describe three
               types of publication biases: (1) file drawer bias, (2) a
               ``repeat study'' bias against the publication of replication
               studies, and (3) a ``gotcha bias'' where replication results
               that run contrary to a prior study are more likely to be
               published. We estimate the model's parameters with a vignette
               experiment conducted with political science professors teaching
               at Ph.D. granting institutions in the United States. We find
               evidence of all three types of bias, although those explicitly
               involving replication studies are notably smaller. This bodes
               well for the replication movement. That said, the aggregation of
               all of the biases increases the number of false positives in a
               literature. We conclude by discussing a path for future work on

               toward open sci-ence practices within the social sciences in
               recent years? Discussions about changes in practices such as
               posting data and pre-registering analyses have been marked by
               controversy---including controversy over the extent to which
               change has taken place. This study, based on the State of Social
               Science (3S) Survey, provides the first com-prehensive
               assessment of awareness of, attitudes towards, perceived norms
               regarding, and adoption of open science practices within a
               broadly representative sample of scholars from four major social
               science disciplines: economics, political science, psychology,
               and so-ciology. We observe a steep increase in adoption: as of
               2017, over 80\% of scholars had used at least one such practice,
               rising from one quarter a decade earlier. Attitudes toward
               research transpar-ency are on average similar between older and
               younger scholars, but the pace of change di˙ers by field and
               methodology. According with theories of normal science and
               scientific change, the timing of increases in adoption coincides
               with technological innovations and institutional policies.
               Patterns are consistent with most scholars underestimating the
               trend toward open science in their discipline.},

	abstract = {In response to widespread concerns about the integrity of
              research published in scholarly journals, several initiatives
              have emerged that are promoting research transparency through
              access to data underlying published scientific findings. Journal
              editors, in particular, have made a commitment to research
              transparency by issuing data policies that require authors to
              submit their data, code, and documentation to data repositories
              to allow for public access to the data. In the case of the
              American Journal of Political Science (AJPS) Data Replication
              Policy, the data also must undergo an independent verification
              process in which materials are reviewed for quality as a
              condition of final manuscript publication and acceptance. Aware
              of the specialized expertise of the data archives, AJPS called
              upon the Odum Institute Data Archive to provide a data review
              service that performs data curation and verification of
              replication datasets. This article presents a case study of the
              collaboration between AJPS and the Odum Institute Data Archive to
              develop a workflow that bridges manuscript publication and data
              review processes. The case study describes the challenges and the
              successes of the workflow integration, and offers lessons learned
              that may be applied by other data archives that are considering
              expanding their services to include data curation and

	abstract = {The vast majority of social science research uses small
               (megabyte- or gigabyte-scale) datasets. These fixed-scale
               datasets are commonly downloaded to the researcher?s computer
               where the analysis is performed. The data can be shared,
               archived, and cited with well-established technologies, such as
               the Dataverse Project, to support the published results. The
               trend toward big data?including large-scale streaming data?is
               starting to transform research and has the potential to impact
               policymaking as well as our understanding of the social,
               economic, and political problems that affect human societies.
               However, big data research poses new challenges to the execution
               of the analysis, archiving and reuse of the data, and
               reproduction of the results. Downloading these datasets to a
               researcher?s computer is impractical, leading to analyses taking
               place in the cloud, and requiring unusual expertise,
               collaboration, and tool development. The increased amount of
               information in these large datasets is an advantage, but at the
               same time it poses an increased risk of revealing personally
               identifiable sensitive information. In this article, we discuss
               solutions to these new challenges so that the social sciences
               can realize the potential of big data.},

               (Herndon, Ash, and Pollin 2013) claimed to show serious errors
               in a highly cited and influential economics paper by Carmen
               Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff (2010). The Reinhart and Rogoff
               paper had come to serve as authoritative evidence in elite
               conversations (Krugman 2013) that high levels of debt,
               especially above the ``90 percent [debt/GDP] threshold''
               (Reinhart and Rogoff 2010, 577), posed a risk to economic
               growth. Much of the coverage of this controversy focused on an
               error that was a ``perfect made-for-TV mistake'' (Stevenson and
               Wolfers 2013) involving a simple error in the formula used in
               their Excel calculations. The real story here, however, is that
               it took three years for this error and other issues to be
               discovered because replication files were not publicly
               available, nor were they provided to scholars when asked. If
               professional norms or the American Economic Review had required

               advanced by three years and discussions about austerity policies

               scientists produce. For these reasons, being a political
               scientist means facing myriad questions about how we know what

              central forum for research debate, moves towards data sharing are
              dependent upon the policies of journals regarding data
              availability. This article examines contemporary data
              availability policies in political science and investigates the

              It also identifies a few factors associated with the existence of

                 disciplinary journals have been placing a growing emphasis on
                 data access and research transparency (DA--RT) practices and
                 policies. As a result, nearly every article that is published
                 today in leading political science journals offers an online
                 appendix that includes data, code, and methodological
                 explanations necessary for replication. While these
                 developments are laudable, many appendices still do not enable
                 satisfactory replication because they are inaccessible,
                 compartmentalized, and difficult to understand. In this
                 article and in its accompanying online appendix, we

                 standardized, and by choosing an adequate online platform on

               introspection about the credibility and utility of their
               discipline. Reform initiatives emphasize the benefits of
               transparency and reproducibility-related research practices;
               however, adoption across the psychology literature is unknown.
               Estimating the prevalence of such practices will help to gauge
               the collective impact of reform initiatives, track progress over
               time, and calibrate future efforts. To this end, we manually
               examined a random sample of 250 psychology articles published
               between 2014 and 2017. Over half of the articles were publicly
               available (154/237, 65\%, 95\% confidence interval [CI] = [59\%,
               71\%]); however, sharing of research materials (26/183; 14\%,
               95\% CI = [10\%, 19\%]), study protocols (0/188; 0\%, 95\% CI =
               [0\%, 1\%]), raw data (4/188; 2\%, 95\% CI = [1\%, 4\%]), and
               analysis scripts (1/188; 1\%, 95\% CI = [0\%, 1\%]) was rare.
               Preregistration was also uncommon (5/188; 3\%, 95\% CI = [1\%,
               5\%]). Many articles included a funding disclosure statement
               (142/228; 62\%, 95\% CI = [56\%, 69\%]), but
               conflict-of-interest statements were less common (88/228; 39\%,
               95\% CI = [32\%, 45\%]). Replication studies were rare (10/188;
               5\%, 95\% CI = [3\%, 8\%]), and few studies were included in
               systematic reviews (21/183; 11\%, 95\% CI = [8\%, 16\%]) or
               meta-analyses (12/183; 7\%, 95\% CI = [4\%, 10\%]). Overall, the
               results suggest that transparency and reproducibility-related

               replication studies has been greatly discussed in most of the
               social sciences, political science included. Indeed, as
               Gherghina and Katsanidou (2013) and Freese (2007) note, to some
               extent, the discussion has been prompted by the tremendous
               changes in publishing in the past decade or so. With the
               enormous expansion in data availability and instant publication
               made possible by the Internet, there now are many opportunities
               to verify the findings presented in the discipline's major
               journals. ``Replication, replication'' has not only become the
               mantra for political science, but for economics, psychology, and
               quantitative sociology as well. These developments opened a

	abstract = {ABSTRACTData access and research transparency (DA-RT) is a
               growing concern for the discipline. Technological advances have
               greatly reduced the cost of sharing data, enabling full
               replication archives consisting of data and code to be shared on
               individual websites, as well as journal archives and
               institutional data repositories. But how do we ensure that
               scholars take advantage of these resources to share their
               replication archives? Moreover, are the costs of research
               transparency borne by individuals or by journals? This article
               assesses the impact of journal replication policies on data
               availability and finds that articles published in journals with
               mandatory provision policies are 24 times more likely to have
               replication materials available than articles those with no
               requirements.},

              However, people frequently lie when asked to provide information,
              such as misrepresenting their income to save money on taxes. A
              landmark finding published in PNAS [L. L. Shu, N. Mazar, F. Gino,

              encouraging honest reporting: asking people to sign a veracity
              statement at the beginning instead of at the end of a self-report
              form. Since this finding was published, various government
              agencies have adopted this practice. However, in this project, we
              failed to replicate this result. Across five conceptual
              replications (n = 4,559) and one highly powered, preregistered,
              direct replication (n = 1,235) conducted with the authors of the

               research misbehavior sparked initiatives to better academic
               science. One initiative is preregistration of quantitative
               research. We investigate whether the preregistration format
               could also be used to boost the credibility of qualitative
               research. A crucial distinction underlying preregistration is
               that between prediction and postdiction. In qualitative
               research, data are used to decide which way interpretation
               should move forward, using data to generate hypotheses and new
               research questions. Qualitative research is thus a real-life
               example of postdiction research. Some may object to the idea of
               preregistering qualitative studies because qualitative research
               generally does not test hypotheses, and because qualitative
               research design is typically flexible and subjective. We rebut
               these objections, arguing that making hypotheses explicit is
               just one feature of preregistration, that flexibility can be
               tracked using preregistration, and that preregistration would
               provide a check on subjectivity. We then contextualize
               preregistrations alongside another initiative to enhance
               credibility in qualitative research: the confirmability audit.
               Besides, preregistering qualitative studies is practically
               useful to combating dissemination bias and could incentivize
               qualitative researchers to report constantly on their study's
               development. We conclude with suggested modifications to the
               Open Science Framework preregistration form to tailor it for

              political science to establish causal relationships, yet the
              identifying assumptions required by an IV design are demanding
              and it remains challenging for researchers to evaluate their
              plausibility. We replicate 61 papers published in three top
              journals in political science from the past decade (2011-2020)
              and document several troubling patterns: (1) researchers often
              miscalculate the first-stage F statistics, overestimating the
              strength of their IVs; (2) most researchers rely on classical
              asymptotic standard errors, which often severely underestimate
              the uncertainties around the two-stage-least-squared (2SLS)
              estimates; (3) in the majority of the replicated studies, the
              2SLS estimates are much bigger than the ordinary-least-squared
              estimates, and their ratio is negatively correlated with the
              strength of the IVs in studies where the IVs are not

              exclusion restriction; such a relationship is much weaker with

	abstract = {Progress in science relies in part on generating hypotheses with
              existing observations and testing hypotheses with new
              observations. This distinction between postdiction and prediction
              is appreciated conceptually but is not respected in practice.
              Mistaking generation of postdictions with testing of predictions
              reduces the credibility of research findings. However, ordinary
              biases in human reasoning, such as hindsight bias, make it hard
              to avoid this mistake. An effective solution is to define the
              research questions and analysis plan before observing the
              research outcomes-a process called preregistration.
              Preregistration distinguishes analyses and outcomes that result
              from predictions from those that result from postdictions. A
              variety of practical strategies are available to make the best
              possible use of preregistration in circumstances that fall short
              of the ideal application, such as when the data are preexisting.
              Services are now available for preregistration across all
              disciplines, facilitating a rapid increase in the practice.
              Widespread adoption of preregistration will increase
              distinctiveness between hypothesis generation and hypothesis
              testing and will improve the credibility of research findings.},

              studies published in three psychology journals using high-powered
              designs and original materials when available. Replication
              effects were half the magnitude of original effects, representing

	abstract = {To address widespread perceptions of a reproducibility crisis
                 in the social sciences, a growing number of scholars recommend
                 the systematic preregistration of empirical studies. The
                 purpose of this article is to contribute to an epistemological
                 dialogue on the value of preregistration in consumer research
                 by identifying the limitations, drawbacks, and potential
                 adverse effects of a preregistration system. After a brief
                 review of some of the implementation challenges that commonly
                 arise with preregistration, we raise three levels of issues
                 with a system of preregistration. First, we identify its
                 limitations as a means of advancing consumer knowledge, thus
                 questioning the sufficiency of preregistration in promoting
                 good consumer science. Second, we elaborate on why consumer
                 science can progress even in the absence of preregistration,
                 thereby also questioning the necessity of preregistration in
                 promoting good consumer science. Third, we discuss serious
                 potential adverse effects of preregistration, both at the
                 individual researcher level and at the level of the field as a
                 whole. We conclude by offering a broader perspective on the
                 narrower role that preregistration can play within the general
                 pursuit of building robust and useful knowledge about

               impacts on both science and society, including misdirected

               are more likely to give red cards to dark-skin-toned players
               than to light-skin-toned players. Analytic approaches varied
               widely across the teams, and the estimated effect sizes ranged
               from 0.89 to 2.93 ( Mdn = 1.31) in odds-ratio units. Twenty
               teams (69\%) found a statistically significant positive effect,
               and 9 teams (31\%) did not observe a significant relationship.
               Overall, the 29 different analyses used 21 unique combinations
               of covariates. Neither analysts' prior beliefs about the effect
               of interest nor their level of expertise readily explained the

               than just misunderstanding. The persistence of poor methods
               results partly from incentives that favour them, leading to the
               natural selection of bad science. This dynamic requires no
               conscious strategizing-no deliberate cheating nor loafing-by
               scientists, only that publication is a principal factor for
               career advancement. Some normative methods of analysis have
               almost certainly been selected to further publication instead of
               discovery. In order to improve the culture of science, a shift
               must be made away from correcting misunderstandings and towards
               rewarding understanding. We support this argument with empirical
               evidence and computational modelling. We first present a 60-year
               meta-analysis of statistical power in the behavioural sciences
               and show that power has not improved despite repeated
               demonstrations of the necessity of increasing power. To
               demonstrate the logical consequences of structural incentives,
               we then present a dynamic model of scientific communities in
               which competing laboratories investigate novel or previously
               published hypotheses using culturally transmitted research
               methods. As in the real world, successful labs produce more
               'progeny,' such that their methods are more often copied and
               their students are more likely to start labs of their own.
               Selection for high output leads to poorer methods and
               increasingly high false discovery rates. We additionally show
               that replication slows but does not stop the process of

               supporters reduced their belief in misinformation items
               following a correction, they did not change their voting
               preferences. Experiment 2 revealed that the explanation's source
               had relatively little impact, and belief updating was more
               influenced by perceived credibility of the individual initially
               purporting the information. These findings suggest that people
               use political figures as a heuristic to guide evaluation of what
               is true or false, yet do not necessarily insist on veracity as a
               prerequisite for supporting political candidates.},

	abstract = {English: Preregistration, which involves documentation of
               hypotheses, methods, and plans for data analysis prior to data
               collection or analysis, has been lauded as 1 potential solution
               to the replication crisis in psychological science. Yet, many
               researchers have been slow to adopt preregistration, and the
               next generation of researchers is offered little formalized
               instruction in creating comprehensive preregistrations. In this
               article, we describe a collaborative workshop-based
               preregistration course designed and taught by Jennifer L.
               Tackett. We provide a brief overview of preregistration,
               including resources available, common concerns with
               preregistration, and responses to these concerns. We then
               describe the goals, structure, and evolution of our
               preregistration course and provide examples of enrolled
               students' final research products. We conclude with reflections
               on the strengths and opportunities for growth for the 1st
               iteration of this course and suggestions for others who are
               interested in implementing similar open science--focused courses

               political science findings are systematic and real. Yet, the

               (DA-RT), analytic transparency calls for radical honesty about
               how political scientists infer conclusions from their data.
               However, honesty about one's research practices often means
               discarding the linguistic template of deductive proceduralism
               that structures most writing, which in turn diminishes the
               prospects for successful publication. This dissonance reflects a
               unique dilemma: transparency initiatives reflect a vision of
               research drawn from the biomedical and natural sciences, and
               struggle with the messier, iterative, and open-ended nature of
               political science scholarship. Analytic transparency requires
               not only better individual practices, such as active citations,
               but also institutional strategies that reward radical honesty.
               Journals can provide authors with protected space to reveal
               research practices, further blind the review process, and
               experiment with special issues. More broadly, analytic openness
               can be mandated through procedural monitoring, such as real-time
               recording of research activities and keystroke logging for
               statistical programs.},

When a protest takes a violent turn, either by the police force or by the protesters, many residents become direct or indirect observers, witnesses or sometimes victims of those violent incidents. This study aims to examine how citizens’ exposure to protest-related violence shifts their opinion about the government and the movement using survey experiments in Hong Kong. Anti-extradition bill protests in 2019 have created unprecedented political and social turmoil in Hong Kong, leading a large number of Hong Kong citizens to experience different levels of violence related to the current social movement. We examine how various forms of protest-related violence affect the public opinion of residents who experienced or observed the incidents, including trust in government, evaluation about the movement, and future prospects. In particular, we focus on different perpetrators of violence: violence by protesters, violence used by law enforcement, and violence by non-state counter-protest actors. The literature has shown that excessive repression against popular protest is politically costly and often ineffective in attenuating social grievances. Studies also generally confirm that violent protests lead to a decline in public support for the movement. Less well understood, however, is how citizens evaluate violent tactics used by different actors within the same movement and how individuals’ experiences with that violence may affect their political opinions. By identifying both treatment and control groups from the eight communities in the city that experienced a specific type of violent event last year, we aim to causally measure the public opinion changes related to protest-related violence at the micro-level.","registration_type":"Outdated EGAP Registration (DO NOT USE)","retracted":false,"title":"The Effects of Protest-related Violence on Neighborhoods","withdrawn":false,"date":"2021-06-15T19:09:11.618333+00:00","affiliations":[],"contributors":["Ji Yeon Hong","Stan Hok-Wui Wong"],"funders":[],"publishers":[],"hosts":[],"identifiers":["http://osf.io/z4tc7/","http://dx.doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/Z4TC7"],"tags":[],"subjects":["bepress|Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"subject_synonyms":[],"lists":{"affiliations":[],"contributors":[{"type":"person","types":["person","agent"],"name":"Ji Yeon Hong","given_name":"Ji","family_name":"Hong","additional_name":"Yeon","identifiers":["http://osf.io/3bw4e/"],"relation":"creator","order_cited":0,"cited_as":"Ji Yeon Hong"},{"type":"person","types":["person","agent"],"name":"Stan Hok-Wui Wong","given_name":"Stan","family_name":"Wong","additional_name":"Hok-Wui","identifiers":["http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7754-5947","http://osf.io/gz8ea/"],"relation":"creator","order_cited":1,"cited_as":"Stan Hok-Wui Wong"}],"funders":[],"publishers":[],"hosts":[],"lineage":[]}}},{"_index":"share_postrend_backcompat","_type":"creativeworks","_id":"E0144-82E-4FB","_score":1.0,"_source":{"id":"E0144-82E-4FB","sources":["egap Registry"],"type":"registration","types":["registration","publication","creative work"],"date_created":"2021-06-15T20:24:33.878517+00:00","date_modified":"2021-09-03T19:02:51.658204+00:00","date_published":"2021-06-15T20:24:24.148354+00:00","description":"Recent studies have challenged the traditional implicit/explicit model and found an increased tolerance for explicit racial appeals.

However, a body of work in judicial politics suggests when citizens are exposed to the symbols of law, their latent positive attitudes towards courts are awakened, making them more accepting of otherwise unfavorable judicial outcomes. This study leverages a 2x3 fully crossed factorial survey experiment to evaluate the effects of VTC use and technology malfunctions, both with and absent the legitimizing symbols of the judiciary, on perceptions of procedural fairness, legitimacy, and outcome acceptance. Ultimately, I build on the literature on expectation and satisfaction to model the interaction between legal symbols and VTC courtrooms as one in which expectations and reality are misaligned and disconfirmation bias emerges, lowering public opinion.","registration_type":"EGAP Registration","retracted":false,"title":"Virtual Legality: ‘’Asylum Free Zones,” Video Teleconferencing, and Bad Tech

the design and planned analysis of a randomized field experiment aimed at registering currently unregistered citizens to vote in the 2020 presidential election in Wisconsin. A central challenge for voter registration is the absence of a list of citizens who are not currently registered to vote. Unlike get-out-the-vote campaigns, which typically start from a list of registered voters as compiled on the voter file, registration campaigns have to identify unregistered voters by other means. We also do not have a list of unregistered voters, but we proxy for this list with the maps of unregistered households produced and shared by mapthevote.com. In treatment neighborhoods (census block groups), we will email all currently registered voters a map of the nearby unregistered households and encourage them to register their neighbors. Our study draws on insights from the nascent literature on relational organizing, which finds that inducements from close social contacts have especially large effects on voter turnout \\citep{green2020_supertreatment}. In our study, we hope to cause currently registered voters to induce their currently unregistered neighbors to vote. This form of organizing is ``relational'' in the sense that it relies on the unmeasured but nevertheless real social network of neighbors in neighborhoods. Our operating assumption is that even though most neighbors don't know most neighbors personally, all neighbors are known to at least some neighbors.","registration_type":"EGAP Registration","retracted":false,"title":"Relational Registration Field Experiment","withdrawn":false,"date":"2020-11-25T22:40:06.605441+00:00","affiliations":[],"contributors":["Alexander Coppock","Ariel White"],"funders":[],"publishers":[],"hosts":[],"identifiers":["http://osf.io/3vu4r/"],"tags":[],"subjects":["bepress|Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"subject_synonyms":[],"lists":{"affiliations":[],"contributors":[{"type":"person","types":["person","agent"],"name":"Alexander Coppock","given_name":"Alexander","family_name":"Coppock","identifiers":["http://osf.io/p3q2g/"],"relation":"creator","order_cited":1,"cited_as":"Alexander Coppock"},{"type":"person","types":["person","agent"],"name":"Ariel White","given_name":"Ariel","family_name":"White","identifiers":["http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9409-6765","http://osf.io/4mt6r/"],"relation":"creator","order_cited":0,"cited_as":"Ariel White"}],"funders":[],"publishers":[],"hosts":[],"lineage":[]}}},{"_index":"share_postrend_backcompat","_type":"creativeworks","_id":"E0223-09D-C92","_score":1.0,"_source":{"id":"E0223-09D-C92","sources":["egap Registry"],"type":"registration","types":["registration","publication","creative work"],"date_created":"2020-10-16T19:44:47.618848+00:00","date_modified":"2021-05-01T00:53:36.428167+00:00","date_published":"2020-10-16T19:44:38.409582+00:00","description":"In emerging markets, where much of the world’s future demand for energy and infrastructure will be located, there is a clear recognition of the central role that businesses can play in promoting green growth and climate action. However, there is less clarity about how to motivate private firms to invest in green technologies and environmentally operations. Some scholars and practitioners emphasize enhanced government regulation and enforcement, while others point to the greater potential of societal pressure. In this study, we plan to use a survey experiment embedded in nationally representative surveys in Vietnam and Myanmar to test which type of stakeholder pressure (government or society) has the strongest impact on whether and how much domestic and foreign business leaders are willing to invest in green operations. In addition, we plan to test how important firm characteristics, such as firm size, export market, ownership structure, and firms’ environmental risk perception moderate this relationship. Below, we present our pre-analysis plan and mock results for this proposed study.","registration_type":"EGAP Registration","retracted":false,"title":"What Drives Corporate Environmentalism in Developing Countries?","withdrawn":false,"date":"2020-10-16T19:44:38.409582+00:00","affiliations":[],"contributors":["Quynh Nguyen","Edmund Malesky"],"funders":[],"publishers":[],"hosts":[],"identifiers":["http://osf.io/79ysb/"],"tags":[],"subjects":["bepress|Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"subject_synonyms":[],"lists":{"affiliations":[],"contributors":[{"type":"person","types":["person","agent"],"name":"Quynh Nguyen","given_name":"Quynh","family_name":"Nguyen","identifiers":["http://osf.io/qauy7/"],"relation":"creator","order_cited":1,"cited_as":"Quynh Nguyen"},{"type":"person","types":["person","agent"],"name":"Edmund Malesky","given_name":"Edmund","family_name":"Malesky","identifiers":["http://osf.io/gbk4p/"],"relation":"creator","order_cited":0,"cited_as":"Edmund Malesky"}],"funders":[],"publishers":[],"hosts":[],"lineage":[]}}},{"_index":"share_postrend_backcompat","_type":"creativeworks","_id":"E00F6-EF0-C36","_score":1.0,"_source":{"id":"E00F6-EF0-C36","sources":["egap Registry"],"type":"registration","types":["registration","publication","creative work"],"date_created":"2020-09-24T18:38:38.672914+00:00","date_modified":"2021-06-18T05:00:59.448748+00:00","date_published":"2019-12-18T22:46:00+00:00","registration_type":"EGAP Registration","retracted":false,"title":"Democracy Ratings, Part 2","withdrawn":false,"date":"2019-12-18T22:46:00+00:00","affiliations":[],"contributors":["Sarah Bush","Melina Platas"],"funders":[],"publishers":[],"hosts":[],"identifiers":["http://osf.io/nh3pc/","http://dx.doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/NH3PC"],"tags":[],"subjects":[],"subject_synonyms":[],"lists":{"affiliations":[],"contributors":[{"type":"person","types":["person","agent"],"name":"Sarah Bush","given_name":"Sarah","family_name":"Bush","identifiers":["http://osf.io/62ejs/"],"relation":"creator","order_cited":0,"cited_as":"Sarah Bush"},{"type":"person","types":["person","agent"],"name":"Melina Platas","given_name":"Melina","family_name":"Platas","identifiers":["http://osf.io/m4jqu/","http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5503-1029"],"relation":"creator","order_cited":1,"cited_as":"Melina Platas"}],"funders":[],"publishers":[],"hosts":[],"lineage":[]}}},{"_index":"share_postrend_backcompat","_type":"creativeworks","_id":"E012B-705-4DF","_score":1.0,"_source":{"id":"E012B-705-4DF","sources":["egap Registry"],"type":"registration","types":["registration","publication","creative work"],"date_created":"2021-06-10T18:44:03.126400+00:00","date_modified":"2021-06-10T18:44:56.846621+00:00","date_published":"2021-06-10T18:43:54.416229+00:00","description":"This study uses a difference-in-differences design to explore the impact of wildfires on voting behaviour in Australia.

Previous studies have found that sexist attitudes correlate with such support. In this study, we propose another explanation: social conformity. A longstanding theory in social phycology suggests that people change their opinions to match others’ responses (Asch 1951). We explore the effects of social conformity using the case of President Duterte of the Philippines, who repeatedly made sexist remarks. We show participants a video clip of Duterte’s sexist remark that he made during his 2016 presidential campaign. Our treatment condition is a version of the video that includes audience laughter, which we regard as a proxy for social influence that imparts social conformity pressure. Our control condition is a version of the video without laughter.","registration_type":"Outdated EGAP Registration (DO NOT USE)","retracted":false,"title":"Social Influence on Voter Support of Sexist Politicians: A Survey Experiment from the Philippines","withdrawn":false,"date":"2021-06-09T18:35:52.454801+00:00","affiliations":[],"contributors":["Yuko Kasuya"],"funders":[],"publishers":[],"hosts":[],"identifiers":["http://osf.io/p8vzb/","http://dx.doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/P8VZB"],"tags":[],"subjects":["bepress|Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"subject_synonyms":[],"lists":{"affiliations":[],"contributors":[{"type":"person","types":["person","agent"],"name":"Yuko Kasuya","given_name":"Yuko","family_name":"Kasuya","identifiers":["http://osf.io/57b3y/"],"relation":"creator","order_cited":0,"cited_as":"Yuko Kasuya"}],"funders":[],"publishers":[],"hosts":[],"lineage":[]}}},{"_index":"share_postrend_backcompat","_type":"creativeworks","_id":"E0233-612-FBA","_score":1.0,"_source":{"id":"E0233-612-FBA","sources":["egap Registry"],"type":"registration","types":["registration","publication","creative work"],"date_created":"2021-06-14T12:57:17.746934+00:00","date_modified":"2021-06-14T15:01:55.678390+00:00","date_published":"2021-06-14T12:57:05.797742+00:00","description":"We execute a series of survey experiments that randomly vary whether the survey measures turnout intentions (a) in the standard way, independently of candidate preferences (the control condition), or (b) as part of the candidate preference question, with \"not vote\" appearing one of the response options (the treatment condition).

We hypothesize that the treatment strengthens the relationship between perceptions of differences between parties/candidates and the intention to turnout, particularly among those with high levels of group consciousness, such as African Americans.

We pose an empirically urgent, normatively salient question: How might we mitigate against the scapegoating of, and even encourage pro-social behavior towards, ethnic minorities on the part of majority ethnic groups in the context of the ongoing pandemic? We use a survey experiment to explore a relatively underemphasized factor—an inclusive nationalism. The dominant association of nationalism is with divisions, discrimination, and conflict. Yet nationalism has also been shown to be a powerful constructive force. The key question is how inclusively the boundaries of the nation are drawn. Drawing together and building on work across political science, sociology, economics, political theory, and social psychology, we study how a superordinate national solidarity that encompasses different ethnic groups can be leveraged to reduce the scapegoating of, and might even encourage prosocial behavior towards, minorities in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic.

However, policymakers remain constrained in their ability to transform research insights into actionable policy interventions aimed at either reducing the incidence of violence or mitigating its effects on citizens.

In this project, we embed an experiment into a citizen survey with vignettes that vary the type of violence, identity of the perpetrator, the number of perpetrators, the identity of the victim, and the number of witnesses involved in hypothetical incidents of violence. The goal is to better understand under what conditions citizens will be willing to report violence as well as the underlying motivation to do so.","registration_type":"Outdated EGAP Registration (DO NOT USE)","retracted":false,"title":"Documenting Electoral Violence: Assessing Tradeoffs in Data Collection Methodologies","withdrawn":false,"date":"2021-06-16T20:25:48.682848+00:00","affiliations":[],"contributors":["Arsène Brice Bado","Allison N.

This study will test whether women in a highly masculine culture versus a highly feminine culture react to media (that is either gender neutral, benevolently discriminatory or hostilely discriminatory) differently. Three primary theoretical paths to politics are considered, based on social and political psychology research: 1) implicit cognition path – women exposed to benevolently discriminatory media experience only implicit through processes that lead to greater system justification, role incongruity between the political and female gender roles and other factors that decrease their interest in entering politics; 2) the reactance path – women exposed to hostile media discrimination in a feminine culture feel anger based motivation to enter politics as a form of collective action on behalf of women; 3) the queen bee path – women exposed to hostile media discrimination in a masculine culture experience self-group distancing as a coping mechanism and enter politics as a way to attain self-advancement in a masculine domain. In the online experiment testing these expectations, the effect of media on other variables is tested, in order to provide some initial suggestive evidence as to the causal mechanisms that cannot be directly tested. Theoretically relevant control variables such as ideology, ethnicity and level of education are included, as these have been found to impact not only women’s political ambition but how women respond to gender discrimination.","registration_type":"Outdated EGAP Registration (DO NOT USE)","retracted":false,"title":"Under what conditions can media discrimination increase women’s political ambition?","withdrawn":false,"date":"2021-06-15T17:04:57.442853+00:00","affiliations":[],"contributors":["Amanda Haraldsson"],"funders":[],"publishers":[],"hosts":[],"identifiers":["http://dx.doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/HP8YF","http://osf.io/hp8yf/"],"tags":[],"subjects":["bepress|Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"subject_synonyms":[],"lists":{"affiliations":[],"contributors":[{"type":"person","types":["person","agent"],"name":"Amanda Haraldsson","given_name":"Amanda","family_name":"Haraldsson","identifiers":["http://osf.io/3ye82/","http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2842-7570"],"relation":"creator","order_cited":0,"cited_as":"Amanda Haraldsson"}],"funders":[],"publishers":[],"hosts":[],"lineage":[]}}},{"_index":"share_postrend_backcompat","_type":"creativeworks","_id":"E0125-86B-6FA","_score":1.0,"_source":{"id":"E0125-86B-6FA","sources":["egap Registry"],"type":"registration","types":["registration","publication","creative work"],"date_created":"2021-06-09T17:35:36.218537+00:00","date_modified":"2021-06-09T18:10:32.452551+00:00","date_published":"2021-06-09T17:35:17.904292+00:00","description":"Project is exploiting a research design (RCT) to test innovative ways to improve the skills and competencies of the local labour force, and to boost employment and growth in the region.","registration_type":"Outdated EGAP Registration (DO NOT USE)","retracted":false,"title":"Urban growth - GSIP Vantaa","withdrawn":false,"date":"2021-06-09T17:35:17.904292+00:00","affiliations":[],"contributors":["Hanna Virtanen","Hannu Karhunen"],"funders":[],"publishers":[],"hosts":[],"identifiers":["http://osf.io/dm86p/","http://dx.doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/DM86P"],"tags":[],"subjects":["bepress|Social and Behavioral Sciences"],"subject_synonyms":[],"lists":{"affiliations":[],"contributors":[{"type":"person","types":["person","agent"],"name":"Hanna Virtanen","given_name":"Hanna","family_name":"Virtanen","identifiers":["http://osf.io/6f7bv/"],"relation":"creator","order_cited":1,"cited_as":"Hanna Virtanen"},{"type":"person","types":["person","agent"],"name":"Hannu Karhunen","given_name":"Hannu","family_name":"Karhunen","identifiers":["http://osf.io/y3mtv/"],"relation":"creator","order_cited":0,"cited_as":"Hannu Karhunen"}],"funders":[],"publishers":[],"hosts":[],"lineage":[]}}},{"_index":"share_postrend_backcompat","_type":"creativeworks","_id":"E007F-997-EBD","_score":1.0,"_source":{"id":"E007F-997-EBD","sources":["egap Registry"],"type":"registration","types":["registration","publication","creative work"],"date_created":"2021-06-09T18:21:14.001338+00:00","date_modified":"2021-06-09T20:31:38.880079+00:00","date_published":"2021-06-09T18:21:04.205912+00:00","description":"This project uses a conjoint survey design to test which attributes affect perceptions of land values and tenure security.

This approach leaves open the possibility that differences in the relative importance of racial and gender attitudes on the evaluation of candidates are due to extraneous factors that are unrelated to the candidates’ racial and/or gender identities. Experimental studies can more confidently isolate the causal effects of racial and gender cues, but are limited by external validity concerns due to their usual reliance on fictional candidates.

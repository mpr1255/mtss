UluslararasÄ± Ä°liÅkiler-International Relations,dataverse,https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/uidergisi,uidergisi,"Uluslararasi Iliskiler (UI), founded in 2004 and currently run by the International Relations Council of Turkey (IRCT), is an independent, international quarterly journal of international relations. The journal seeks to publish articles that make theoretically and empirically original contributions to the literature on national, regional, or global politics. The journal is particularly interested in articles that combine conceptual and theoretical perspectives with empirical analyses that rely upon qualitative, quantitative, or mixed method approaches. Indexed in top research databases, despite not publishing exclusively in English, the journal prides itself in its double-blind peer-review process. For more information on the journalâs submission process, please visit the journal's website. For authors who are submitting replication files, please see the Guide to Dataverse shared by the Editor. Once an article is accepted for publication by the Editorial Board of UluslararasÄ± Ä°liÅkiler, authors are expected to upload replication material to the Dataverse repository, accessible here: https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/uidergisi Authors using quantitative data are required to deposit the following material on to UluslararasÄ± Ä°liÅkilerâs Dataverse: the data, the code book or another appropriate description of the data set, a file containing the exact commands used by the author to generate the output, and the actual output from the statistical software. All online appendices (quantitative or not) are to be deposited on to UluslararasÄ± Ä°liÅkilerâs Dataverse. An article will not be forwarded to proof stage until this is completed. While not required, authors that rely upon non-quantitative approaches can submit data onto UluslararasÄ± Ä°liÅkilerâs Dataverse that cannot be included within the article. All material published in the Dataverse are the responsibility of the authors alone (Dataverse'te yayÄ±nlanan verilerin sorumluluÄu makalenin yazarlarÄ±na aittir).",2019-10-10T11:42:42Z,Uluslararasi Iliskiler-International Relations,0.152005392652511
